# Basic GPU Pipeline Example

This project provides simplified examples of a GPU pipeline for educational purposes. It demonstrates the interactions between memory and the vertex shader, tiler, rasterisation and fragment shader pipeline stages and other components commonly found in GPU HW architectures. The repository now contains a 2D triangle example, a minimal 3D cube rendered from a side perspective, and a textured cube example that maps an image (or a randomly generated pattern) to each face.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bvarbanov90/basic-gpu-pipeline-example.git
    ```
    Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd basic-gpu-pipeline-example
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment.
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will start the Jupyter Notebook and open a browser window. Navigate to the directory where you cloned this project.

2. **Open Notebook**
    - In the Jupyter Notebook browser window, click on `basic_2D_GPU_pipeline_example.ipynb` for the 2D triangle pipeline.
    - Open `basic_3D_GPU_pipeline_example.ipynb` to explore the 3D cube example.
    - To see a cube with the same image applied as a texture on all faces, run `textured_cube_example.ipynb`. Place a `texture.jpg` image in the repository root to use your own texture; otherwise a random one is generated automatically.

3. **Run Notebook**
    - You can run each cell individually by clicking on it and pressing `Shift + Enter`, or run all cells by clicking `Cell > Run All` in the menu.

4. **View Results**
    - The final cell will display the rasterized image generated by the chosen pipeline. You can also view the saved image in your local directory.
